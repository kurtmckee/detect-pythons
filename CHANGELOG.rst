1.0.0 - 2023-10-26
==================

Initial release
---------------

*   Support the latest hosted GitHub runners.
*   Support at least Python 2.7 and Python 3.8+.
*   Use paths and ``sysconfig.get_config_var("EXT_SUFFIX")``
    (and, for the system-installed CPython 2.7 on macOS,
    an ``EXT_SUFFIX``-alike) to construct a cache-busting string.
