1.1.1 - 2025-03-06
==================

Python support
--------------

*   Support CPython 3.13 and PyPy 3.11.

.. _changelog-1.1.0:

1.1.0 - 2023-12-16
==================

Python support
--------------

*   Document that GraalPy is a supported interpreter, and test it.

*   Locally test against early Python 3.13 versions.

Changed
-------

*   ``None`` should no longer appear in the identifier
    for Python interpreters missing an ``EXT_SUFFIX`` sysconfig value.

*   Simplify how the action runs.

    Previously, the underlying shell scripts were embedded directly into ``action.yml``.

Documentation
-------------

*   Document current ``macos-latest`` runner variability.

.. _changelog-1.0.0:

1.0.0 - 2023-10-26
==================

Initial release
---------------

*   Support the latest hosted GitHub runners.
*   Support at least Python 2.7 and Python 3.8+.
*   Use paths and ``sysconfig.get_config_var("EXT_SUFFIX")``
    (and, for the system-installed CPython 2.7 on macOS,
    an ``EXT_SUFFIX``-alike) to construct a cache-busting string.
